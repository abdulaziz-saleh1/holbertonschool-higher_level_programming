# Basics of HTTP/HTTPS

## 1. Difference Between HTTP and HTTPS

- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** is the basic protocol for communication between a web client and a server.
- **HTTPS (HTTP Secure)** is the secured version of HTTP that uses **SSL/TLS encryption**.
- **HTTP** sends data in plain text, making it vulnerable to **eavesdropping**.
- **HTTPS** encrypts the data, ensuring **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **authentication** â€” especially important for login pages, banking, and email.
