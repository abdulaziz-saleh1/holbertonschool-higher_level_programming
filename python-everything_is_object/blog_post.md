## Conclusion

Whether you're working with numbers or complex data structures, understanding Python's object model is key. Remember:

* Use `id()` and `type()` to inspect objects.
* Know when objects are shared or copied.
* Mutable types can lead to unexpected side-effects if you're not careful.
* Functions modify mutable arguments in-place, but not immutable ones.

This knowledge is essential not just for Python interviews but also for writing efficient and bug-free Python code.
